- Every counter can have multiple _atomic counter_ with separate names
- The sum of all _atomic counters_ is displayed at the top of the counter
- For every _atomic counter_ a value can be defined (shown as **count \* value**)
- The sum of all values is displayed at the top of the counter
- For every counter an unit can be defined
- If an unit is present the unit is shown after the values
